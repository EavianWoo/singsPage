# Framework

SinGS architecture comprises two main components:
- **Kinematic Human Diffusion (KHD) - The eigen of SinGS**:

  A diffusion-based architecture designed to sample within human kinematic space instead of pure camera space (e.g SDS-based multi-view generation), generating identity-consistent image sequences across a wide range of human motions involving turning poses â€” with natural fluidity.

- **Geometry-Preserving 3DGS (CGS) - The thruster and stabilizer of SinGS**:

  A triplane-based networks to learn geometry and appearance for animatable avatar, benefit from the hybrid representation that combines mesh structure and Gaussian primitives
  By introducing two key strategies:

    1. Semantic Laplacian Regularization

    2. Geometry-Preserving Density Control

  GPGS maintains high-quality results even under imperfect priors.
